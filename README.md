## Introduction


The primary goal of this project was to create a Face Mask Detector system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The system was designed to analyze facial images and determine whether a person is wearing a face mask, identify the type of mask being worn, and assess if the mask is worn correctly. Additionally, the project aimed to address potential biases in the model related to gender and age through the implementation of various image augmentation methods.

Throughout the project, the CNN architecture was tailored to effectively perform image analysis tasks, including the identification of face masks and their correct usage. The team explored and implemented diverse image augmentation techniques to mitigate biases associated with gender and age, ensuring a more inclusive and robust face mask detection system.

In summary, the project focused on developing a sophisticated CNN-based solution for face mask detection, encompassing not only the presence of a mask but also its type and proper wear, while actively working to eliminate biases in gender and age through strategic image augmentation methods.
