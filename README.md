# FaceMaskDetector
The objective of the project was to develop a face mask detector system using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that can analyse face images and detect whether a person is wearing a face mask or not, the type of mask that is being worn, and whether the mask is worn correctly. We also examined the possible bias in the model for gender and age and tried to eliminate it using different image augmentation methods.The objective of the project was to develop a face mask detector system using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that can analyse face images and detect whether a person is wearing a face mask or not, the type of mask that is being worn, and whether the mask is worn correctly.
